The lighthouse stood on a rocky shore, its beam cutting through the fog like a knife. I climbed the spiral stairs, each step echoing in the hollow tower. At the top, I found her tending the light, her hands steady despite the storm raging outside.

"The ships need to see," she said, not looking at me. "They're lost in the dark."

I wanted to tell her that I was lost too, that I needed her light to guide me home. But the words caught in my throat, and I watched her work in silence. The beam swept across the water, searching for something I couldn't see.

When I woke, I could still hear the foghorn calling across the waves.
