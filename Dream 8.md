The clock tower stood in the center of an empty city, its hands frozen at midnight. I climbed the winding stairs, each step creaking under my weight. At the top, I found her winding the clock, her movements precise and methodical.

"Time stopped here," she said. "But it's starting again."

I watched as she turned the key, and the clock began to tick. The sound echoed through the empty streets below, and I felt something shift in the air. The city was waking up, but slowly, like someone emerging from a deep sleep.

"What happens when it reaches midnight again?" I asked.

She looked at me with eyes that held centuries. "We find out if we're ready for what comes next."
