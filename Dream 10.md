The storm rolled in like a living thing, clouds dark and heavy with purpose. She stood on the shore, facing the waves that crashed against the rocks. I called out to her, but the wind carried my words away.

"The storm is coming," she said, though I could barely hear her over the thunder. "But I'm not afraid."

I joined her on the shore, and together we watched the lightning split the sky. The rain came down in sheets, soaking us to the skin, but she was smiling. There was something beautiful about the chaos, something that made the world feel alive and dangerous and real.

When the storm passed, we were still standing, and the world felt clean and new.
