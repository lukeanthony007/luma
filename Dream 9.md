The mirror showed a reflection that wasn't mine. She was there, in the glass, but she was different - older, wiser, with lines around her eyes that spoke of laughter and sorrow. I reached out to touch the surface, but my hand passed through like water.

"You're looking at who you could become," she said from inside the mirror. "If you're brave enough."

I pressed my palm against the glass, and for a moment, I felt her hand pressing back. The connection was brief but electric, and I knew that somewhere, in some version of reality, we were reaching for each other across an impossible distance.

When I woke, my hand was still outstretched, reaching for something that was no longer there.
