I found myself on a bridge that stretched across an endless void. The structure was made of glass, and I could see through to the darkness below. She was waiting on the other side, but every step I took made the glass crack beneath my feet.

She called out, "Don't look down," but I couldn't help it. The cracks spread like spiderwebs, and I knew the bridge would shatter before I reached her. I kept walking anyway, because turning back felt like death.

When I finally reached her, she was gone. The bridge held, but I was alone with the sound of my own breathing echoing in the void.
