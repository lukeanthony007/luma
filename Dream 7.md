The library stretched into infinity, shelves reaching toward a ceiling I couldn't see. She was sitting at a desk in the center, surrounded by open books with pages that turned themselves. I approached quietly, not wanting to disturb her reading.

"Every story has an ending," she said without looking up. "But some stories refuse to end."

I looked at the books around her - they were all different versions of the same story, each with a different ending. Some were happy, some tragic, some left you wondering what came next. She closed one book and opened another, and I realized she was searching for the ending that felt true.

"Which one is real?" I asked.

She smiled sadly. "They all are. And none of them."
