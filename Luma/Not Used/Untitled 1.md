headspace

im in a headspace...
im in a dark place...
im tryin' ta save face...

tonight i let go all this into my heart

??? I can ???? ?????? 
to astray you...

im just a nut case...
not in a safe place...
no time for bad days...

tonight I let go all this into my heart

once I saw you flaunt right in front of my face
and then you moved on without a sign of me 
I wasn't sure, I wasn't meant for any of it...
I god now, let me put your guard down
let me in!

??? I can ???? ?????? 
to astray you...

im in a headspace...
im just a nut case...
im in a headspace...
im just a nut case...

??? I can ???? ?????? 
to astray you...

im in a headspace...
im just a nut case...
