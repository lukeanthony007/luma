The garden was overgrown, vines choking the paths and flowers blooming in impossible colors. She was kneeling among the roses, her hands stained with earth and thorns. I called her name, but she didn't turn around.

"The roses need pruning," she said softly. "They're growing wild."

I knelt beside her, and together we worked in silence. The thorns drew blood, but the pain felt necessary somehow. As we cleared the paths, I realized the garden was healing itself, the wild growth giving way to something more beautiful than before.

When the work was done, she finally looked at me. "Some things need to die so others can live," she said. And I understood.
